Applying RoutePanel for TimeLineEditor

long break... I'm lazy...

03_01_2019:
Simple reorganisation & preparing change Progress notes.

04_01_2019:
√ - Create Trigonometric helper.
√ - UnitTests for trigonometric helper
Gathering Decimal information (23 bits unused [from 128])

05_01_2019:
℗  Center overall revork/rethink.
℗  Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
℗  Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
℗  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
℗  CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper.
℗  CentreSound also need rework.

...few day (weekend) break.

08_01_2019:
x  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
╦  UnitTests for ResourceManager.
   ResourceManager XML serialization support.
   ManualUpdader thought
√  FileAssistant

09_01_2019:
╦  FileAssistant
℗  Few Shape implementations
	℗  Circle
	℗  Square
	℗  Triangle
   Removal TimeLineCentre & Immidiatelly regretting this decition. Creating new TimeLineCenter.
℗  TimeLineCentre
╦  AnimationElement (partially, without methods: Update, Render)
√  ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)

10_01_2019:
   JSON serialization
   new UnitTests for missed internal methods
   Fixing compilation issues (Project is compilable now)
℗  TimeLineCenter - unit tests & further implementation
℗  TimeLine - XML Serialization issue (Queue has no accessor)

11_01_2019:
   All Tests are Passing
   ResourceManager, FileAssistant & TimeLineCentre changes

TODO Legend:
○ - TODO
℗ - In progress
√ - Implemented
╦ - Tested
x - Abandoned

TODO Notes:
℗  CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper.
℗  CentreSound also need rework.
○  Think - about remaking AnimationGroupElements to unlimited groupping.
○  There is still trigonometric movement to implement, right?
℗  Center overall revork/rethink.
○  Think - about IManualUpdate and if ManualUpdate should be handled by static methods.
○  Think - ManualUpdated - leave it as static methods?
○  Placement for IGraphicElement needs change?
℗  Few Shape implementations
	℗  Circle
	℗  Square
	℗  Triangle
○  Think - about colissions is this supposed to be Unitiy Colliders?
		Ye, the best would be...
℗  Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
℗  Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
○  CentreResource for nested structures
○  Logging
√  ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)
℗  TimeLineCentre
℗  TimeLine
○  Think - Should it be better if ResourceManager could hold filenames with extensions. For deserialization purposes?
