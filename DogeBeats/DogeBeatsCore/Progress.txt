Applying RoutePanel for TimeLineEditor

long break... I'm lazy...

03_01_2019:
Simple reorganisation & preparing change Progress notes.

04_01_2019:
√ - Create Trigonometric helper.
√ - UnitTests for trigonometric helper
Gathering Decimal information (23 bits unused [from 128])

05_01_2019:
℗  Center overall revork/rethink.
℗  Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
℗  Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
℗  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
℗  CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper.
℗  CentreSound also need rework.

...few day (weekend) break.

08_01_2019:
x  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
╦  UnitTests for ResourceManager.
   ResourceManager XML serialization support.
   ManualUpdader thought
√  FileAssistant

09_01_2019:
╦  FileAssistant
℗  Few Shape implementations (Resources)
	℗  Circle
	℗  Square
	℗  Triangle
   Removal TimeLineCentre & Immidiatelly regretting this decition. Creating new TimeLineCenter.
℗  TimeLineCentre
╦  AnimationElement (partially, without methods: Update, Render)
√  ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)

10_01_2019:
   JSON serialization
   new UnitTests for missed internal methods (FileAssistant, ResourceManaget, TimeLineCenter)
   Fixing compilation issues (Project is compilable now)
℗  TimeLineCenter - unit tests & further implementation
℗  TimeLine - XML Serialization issue (Queue has no accessor)

11_01_2019:
   All Tests are Passing
   ResourceManager, FileAssistant & TimeLineCentre changes
   There are still some things to adjust

12_01_2019:
√  Think - Should it be better if ResourceManager could hold filenames with extensions. For deserialization purposes? - YES

13_01_2019 (Sat):
	Found problem with ResourceManager Dictionary Key with extension is hard to retreive from Contains method (filename without extension).
	
14_01_2019:
√	Think - about colissions is this supposed to be Unitiy Colliders?
√	Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
√	Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
√	Think - about IManualUpdate and if ManualUpdate should be handled by static methods.
√	Think - ManualUpdated - leave it as static methods?

15_01_2019: (3-4h)
√	Think - about remaking AnimationGroupElements to unlimited groupping.
╦	CentreResource for nested structures
╦	ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)
╦	TimeLineCentre
╦	Center overall revork/rethink.
╦	CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper. 

16_01_2019 (1h 15min):
√	Changing all ElementsNAme to Name, Implementing Interface with name prop
℗	SoundCentre
℗	Think about structure of SoundCentre. Since it should be places in Proxy and at Resources section at the same time.
	Centre module excludion. Interface, 2 base classes. 
	Sound Centre needs adjustments, since it should return Sound object instead of bytes, which ResourceManager are taking care of.
	Generating 13 unpassable test units

17_01_2019 (sick) ~1h:
	Think about implementation for CentreFileBase Generic class
√	SoundCentre finished. New interface for IByteParsable for Sound item.
	14 unpassable test

18_01_2019 (very sick)

19_01_2019 (still kinda sick) 1h:
	6 unpassable tests
	Things to do:
		need to hide Resource Dictionary from ResourceManager, Issue: missleading key.
		need to change retreiving objects fromm centres. Keys with extension needed. See test for more memory refresh.
√	Think about structure of SoundCentre. Since it should be places in Proxy and at Resources section at the same time.

20_01_2019 (Sat) 1h:
	All test passes
	Things done:
		keys in centre dictionaries & ResourceManager are now stored without lowering name. CaseSenssitive with extensions
		ResourceDictionary is now private.
	Centres looks finished!
╦	SoundCentre
√	Assumptions out!
╦	Changing all ElementsNAme to Name, Implementing Interface with name prop
╦	CentreSound also need rework. Name will probably differ, since it should be proxy
╦	need to hide Resource Dictionary from ResourceManager, Issue: missleading key.
╦	need to change retreiving objects fromm centres. Keys with extension needed. See test for more memory refresh.

21_01_2019 (Sun) 1h:
√	AnimationGroupElements to unlimited groupping.
	√	Interface for AnimationElement
	√	Two classes. 1 for Group, 1 for singleElement.
	Think & implement - AnimationElementRoute rework (preparing for trigonometric movement).
	ManualUpdaterParser
√	AnimationElementRouteFrame
		ManualUpdater
		Rework
℗	AnimationElementRoute
		ManualUpdater
℗	AnimationElementSingleElement
℗	AnimationElementGroupElement
℗	AnimationElementElement

22_01_2019: 1h
√	Think - About Merging AnimaationRouteGroup with AnimationRoute
	AnimaationRouteGroup out!
℗	AnimationElementRoute
℗	System rework v2 (Trigonometric Movement, Merged AnimationElements & AnimationRoute, ManualUpdate)
℗	Think - Placement reorganization (AnimationElemnts)
℗	ITLEPanelElement update

23_01_2019: 1h
℗	Think - Placement Update method (with group placement or without) - With. Or is it...
℗	System rework v2 (Trigonometric Movement, Merged AnimationElements & AnimationRoute, ManualUpdate)
	ImageItem & ImageCentre
	CentreFileBase fixes
	AnimationElements & Routes should be now finished. No Tests yet.
