Applying RoutePanel for TimeLineEditor

long break... I'm lazy...

03_01_2019:
Simple reorganisation & preparing change Progress notes.

04_01_2019:
√ - Create Trigonometric helper.
√ - UnitTests for trigonometric helper
Gathering Decimal information (23 bits unused [from 128])

05_01_2019:
℗  Center overall revork/rethink.
℗  Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
℗  Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
℗  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
℗  CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper.
℗  CentreSound also need rework.

...few day (weekend) break.

08_01_2019:
x  Think - if the GameGlobal class idea is better than static classes.
╦  UnitTests for ResourceManager.
   ResourceManager XML serialization support.
   ManualUpdader thought
√  FileAssistant

09_01_2019:
╦  FileAssistant
℗  Few Shape implementations
	℗  Circle
	℗  Square
	℗  Triangle
   Removal TimeLineCentre & Immidiatelly regretting this decition. Creating new TimeLineCenter.
℗  TimeLineCentre
╦  AnimationElement (partially, without methods: Update, Render)
√  ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)

10_01_2019:
   JSON serialization
   new UnitTests for missed internal methods
   Fixing compilation issues (Project is compilable now)
℗  TimeLineCenter - unit tests & further implementation
℗  TimeLine - XML Serialization issue (Queue has no accessor)

11_01_2019:
   All Tests are Passing
   ResourceManager, FileAssistant & TimeLineCentre changes
   There are still some things to adjust

12_01_2019:
√  Think - Should it be better if ResourceManager could hold filenames with extensions. For deserialization purposes? - YES

13_01_2019 (Sat):
	Found problem with ResourceManager Dictionary Key with extension is hard to retreive from Contains method.
	
14_01_2019:
√	Think - about colissions is this supposed to be Unitiy Colliders?
√	Think - bout usability of Assumptions class, if it is even necessary near GameGlobal class.
√	Think - about reorganisating classes, is Model folder necessary?
√	Think - about IManualUpdate and if ManualUpdate should be handled by static methods.
√	Think - ManualUpdated - leave it as static methods?

15_01_2019:
√	Think - about remaking AnimationGroupElements to unlimited groupping.
√	CentreResource for nested structures

TODO Legend:
○ - TODO
℗ - In progress
√ - Implemented
╦ - Tested
x -	Abandoned

TODO Notes:
℗	CenterTimeLine needs full rework. Exclude FileHelper. 
℗	CentreSound also need rework. Name will probably differ, since it should be proxy.
○	Changing all ElementsNAme to Name, Implementing Interface with name prop
○	AnimationGroupElements to unlimited groupping
○	There is still trigonometric movement to implement, right?
℗	Center overall revork/rethink.
○	Placement for IGraphicElement needs change?
℗	Few Shape implementations
	℗	Circle
	℗	Square
	℗	Triangle
○	CentreResource for nested structures
○	Logging
√	ResourceManager GetAllOfSerializedObjects & SetAllOfSerializedObjects methods (With test, although cant launch yet)
